## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorming

What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
**The most interesting topic covered in the domain this quarter is the integration of geospatial data analysis with electric grid infrastructure management, particularly in the context of Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) events. The combination of weather data analysis, spatial joins, and network graph creation to model and predict PSPS probabilities was quite difficult but interesting to me.**

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
**A potential investigation I would like to pursure is to incorporate additoanl factors such as population density, critical infrastructure locations, and historical outage data to prioritize switch placements. In addition I would like to explore how I can use machine learning to determine optimal locations for multiple switches across the entire network not just a single circuit.**


What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
**A potential change to the current approach could be to incorporate machine learning techniques for more accurate PSPS probability predictions. Instead of using a fixed threshold for wind speed, a machine learning model could be trained on historical data to predict PSPS events based on multiple factors such as wind speed, humidity, temperature, and vegetation conditions. This approach could potentially improve the accuracy of PSPS predictions and determine future positioning.**

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
**I would be interested in utilizing advande visualization tehcniques such as interactive dashboards or 3d mapping to map our given data out. In addition, right now I am in a natural language processing class so being able to incorporate unstructured data sources like weather reports or maintenance logs to predict which conductors or power lines are at risk could be quite interseting.**
